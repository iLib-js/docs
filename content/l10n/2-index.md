loctool
====
This tool reads source files in various formats, extracts strings for translation, and writes out the translated strings the various resource file formats needed by each project.

### Installation

To install the loctool, you will need to make sure you have nodejs installed on your machine and in your path, as this is used to run the code. (Use 7.0 or later) 

Once nodejs is installed, you can install the loctool itself. You can either get it from npm or from github.com:  

Depending on the language of your project, you will need to install additional plugins as well.
Please refer to ilib-loctool's [plugin information](6-index).
